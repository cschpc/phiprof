Phiprof a simple library that can be used to profile parallel MPI
programs. It can be used to produce a hierarchical report of time
(average, max, min) spent in different timer regions. A log format can
also be written, where the performance as a function of time may be
reported.

Features
  * Supports C++ and C 
  * Low overhead (Less than 1 us)
  * Can print the total time as a human-readable hierarchical report
  * Automatically handles cases where groups of processes execute different codepaths

Not supported
  * No Fortran interface
  * Phiprof does not automatically add regions, these have to be added manually into the code.


INSTALLATION

1) Enter src/ folder

2) Edit Makefile if needed to set the correct compilation options and
compiler names. Phiprof should be compiled with a MPI compiler and
openmp threading should be enabled

3) make 

4) The library files are after compilation in lib/ and headers in
include/ . These can manually be moved to sensible locations, or one
can add the correct -I and -L flags to the compiler commands. For
shared library you may also need to add the path to LD_LIBRARY_PATH



USAGE

Look at the examples in phiprof/example (in particular hello_world)
and read the descriptions in include/phiprof.hpp.
