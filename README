Phiprof a simple library that can be used to profile parallel MPI
programs developed originally at the Finnish Meteorological
Institute. It can be used to produce a hierarchical report of time
(average, max, min) spent in different timer regions. A log format can
also be written, where the performance as a function of time may be
reported.


Features
  * Supports C++ and C (C programs have to be linked with a C++ compiler)
  * Low overhead (Less than 1 us)
  * Can print the total time as a human-readable hierarchical report
  * Automatically handles cases where groups of processes execute different codepaths

Not supported
  * No Fortran interface
  * Phiprof does not automatically add regions, these have to be added manually into the code.


INSTALLATION

Enter phiprof/src folder
edit Makefile 
make
Install lib and .h files from phiprof/lib and phiprof/include into suitable location 

USAGE

Look at the examples in phiprof/example and read the descriptions in include/phiprof.hpp
